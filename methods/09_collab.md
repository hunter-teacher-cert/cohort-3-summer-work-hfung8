1. Select an assignment from class: Project #3 for coding bootcamp. In the coding bootcamp that I was a TA, students had to create 3 projects. 

2. Select a groupwork approach/technique: Rather than using groups that are heterogeneously grouped, try using a homogeneous grouping technique instead. This was an interesting difference, groups were usually hetergeneously grouped by the TA's during the bootcamp.

4. Flesh out the "teaching-facing" parts of this assignment to **address specifics how the groupwork components** will be worked in:
* Intended benefits of groupwork over solo work?
  * The projects are meant to be completed in groups. They are meant to be big projects. 
* Mechanisms for gauging how well it is working?
  * If there is limited to no arguing going on during the bootcamp, then the groups are grouped well. Also, if there are no students who are complaining about how they did more work than their partners. These are the usual complaints that we received at the bootcamp. 
* What to do when trouble erupts?
  * If there are students who are upset about their groups, try to work it out with them. For the most part, students didn't get along because they felt that they had to do more work than others. With the homogeneous groups, the reason for dispute would be because of a difference in personalities rather than skill level.  
* What instructions/guidance will students get re: the groupwork mechanics?
  * The students will be advised to work on the project collaboratively and to work out any differences that they have encountered. 
* What long-term or class-wide goals does this suport, and how?
  * The homogeneous grouping could create relationships in the classroom that were previously missing. Students who didn't hang out with each other coudl start to because they understand that they are at a similar level to the other students.
