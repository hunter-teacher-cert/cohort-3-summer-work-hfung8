Technique: ___
### Technique: Different levels of difficulty for assignments

#### Well-suited to...
Labs, group work or independent work.

#### Example
* LinearSearch, BinarySearch, loops, recursion, etc.
* (any topic as long as students are working on tasks and not a codealong)

### Technique: Diagrams before coding

#### Well-suited to...
Be a preliminary step before diving into the coding, generates conversation between classmates

#### Example
* LikedList methods.

### Technique: Pseudocode

#### Well-suited to...
It helps to understand how the program should work

### Technique: Whiteboarding

Keeping track of the values of variables -- students can write down the value and then update it when it is changed (for example in iteration).

#### Example
Useful for any code that involves changing the value of a variable.
  
### Technique: Cheatsheet

#### Well-suited to...
For making students get familiar with a programming language.

#### Example
* Cheatsheet for JAVA syntax (or any other programming lang)


Example
name of a coding activity (like BinarySearch, For loops, etc)
name of a not-necessarily coding activity
code snippet to illustrate
etc
