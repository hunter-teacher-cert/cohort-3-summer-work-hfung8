Club
How It Works
The club is a low stakes environment for students who want to learn about coding. In the club there will also be upper classmen to teach newcomers about coding. There will be activities and opportunities to see how computer science is used in the community. This club will find programs and trips in the city that will expand their knowledge of computer science. Expected positive outcomes will include an increased passion for students who show interest in computer science. It will also provide practice for the upperclassmen and opportunities for them to teach and mentor new students. 

This club expects to begin within the first few weeks of school and formally, students will meet once a week. But informally, after school will be open for students to just come in and work on anything extra. In the near term, within the first few weeks of meeting, a general sense of student strength will be assessed and roles can be given out based on skill set. Long term, over the course of years, newer students will gain more experience and roles can be revised based on new experience. 

Milestones will include contests that students can participate in on a city wide and nationwide level. Additional milestones can be the enthusiasm students share when displaying their projects that showcase increasing complexity. 

Mechanisms for gauging efficacy will include student enthusiasm and also completion of projects and participation in contests. Finally, these mechanisms can be quantified by the amount of students joining the club. 

Expected Hurdles and Plans to Overcome
The first hurdle will be to get administration on board when we transform the club from within the school to participation in city wide and nation wide events. The way to overcome this is to keep administration in the loop about the advantages of these activities and how these activities will bring increased awareness to our school's STEM program.  

The second hurdle will be finding teachers to join the club and provide mentorship and additional support along with participation in events outside of the school. The way to overcome this is to interview students about which teachers they want as part of the program. Additionally, our club will work side by side with other STEM clubs such as Robotics, etc. This way, the teachers that run these other clubs will feel like they are associated with the Computer Science club as well.  

The third hurdle will be having student engagement in these activities. This hurdle can be overcome through our mentoring program where upperclassmen will work with new students to help them feel more confident in their code. Also, presentations will allow for a system of awards where students can award their peers for outstanding projects.
